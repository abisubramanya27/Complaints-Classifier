NSpam,this is my fifth complaint against key bank because of excessive overdraft fees i am attaching documentation that shows how confusing and dishonest key bank s posting practices are unfortunately this kind of theft affects people like me who do not have assets and have poor credit otherwise i would have an overdraft protection account and i would never incur these fees this is not only about my funds being low because actually my funds are n t low right now and i incurred the last xxxx overdraft notices with a positive balance now that s key bank magical accounting for you i m posting this now but i am accumulating some other concerns that i am noticing now that i am having to pay attention so closely to my account and not rely on key bank to do the math some of my items disappear from the ledger at times the other thing that is happening now is that my pending items are coming out of pending status quickly i will be addressing these things in future complaints this is takes an incredible amount of my time i am doing this for other folks who for various reasons are not able to study their accounts there is no reason why the bank can not add and subtract well enough to keep track of people s balances i do n t even know how much i actually have in the bank now i do n t know how to find out either i have a ledger that i keep for my own records and it does not coincide with key bank s accounting key bank changes the order of debits and credits in order to receive overdraft funds from people who do not have assets or good credit in order to protect themselves from this stealing in which this bank participates i have attached the overdraft notice that i received this morning xx xx xxxx and i have attached the ledger from xx xx xxxx copied at several times during the day to show first that there is no record in the ledger itself of the xxxx that is credited to the account with the deposit that i made that morning it shows up in the balance part of the ledger at the top of the page but not in the description in addition this same deposit that was made at the atm disappears later in the day as does the xxxx debit where do they go there is a note that says that key bank is working on the account and some items might not be available but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the xxxx charge i have gotten xxxx overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the hassle free account which is my son s account they are both my accounts i should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts so on xx xx xxxx i started the day with a positive balance and ended the day with a positive balance having deposited xxxx into my account yet i bounced xxxx items though i was only charged for xxxx this is very unclear unprofessional accounting if i did not have direct deposits coming into this account i would close it and the thing about it is that it would not matter to key bank at all if they lost my business they do not care about their customers as evidenced by the fact that i have spent a lot of time this week complaining because of their over draft practices and they keep overdrafting me even with a positive balance get it together key bank adding and subtracting are basic math skills that you should have stop reordering items to benefit yourselves give people a break last month you bounced xxxx debit transactions of mine that came all together to a little over xxxx you made almost xxxx off of those transactions 
NSpam,i have gone back and forth with both transunion and xxxx credit reporting agencies i have disputed and disputed and they remove some things and then reinsert them again making my score go down by over xxxx points i do n t know what to do as the debts they are talking about are in most cases over years old and in the state of nevada credit card debt is only collectible for years they are ruining my credit and i ca n t get another card to pay off a high interest card with a no interest card the new ones in question are from long ago charged off credit cards from xxxx i am attaching a letter sent to them to inform the credit card companies of the charged off nature of the xxxx accounts they are from xx xx xxxx and xx xx xxxx 
NSpam,in xxxx of xxxx i bought a new car the dealer told me that i would be contacted by citizen one then rbs citizens about the exact amount of each monthly payment and about the exact date each payment would be due sometime shortly after that citizen one sent me my first monthly billing statement for the next years citizen one set a precedent and created an expectation by regularly sending me monthly billing statements during that time i faithfully made each payment on time and on several occasions made monthly payments for several months in advance for these reasons i relied on receiving my monthly billing statement from citizen one to know the exact amount of and the exact due date of my next loan installment in xxxx xxxx citizen one suddenly and unexpectedly stopped sending me billing statements i did n t notice i had been habituated by their monthly notices and i had been trained to think of sending a payment only after i was notified and as a direct result of citizen one s failure to send a monthly billing statement i was late with my xxxx payment when their credit department contacted me i sent months payments current one month in advance and notified them that i had n t received a statement their customer service representative told me that i should have received a monthly billing statement it was citizen one s policy to do so verified my contact information which had n t changed and under the circumstances waived the fee i had been assessed for being late she also assured me that i would start to receive monthly billing statements again unfortunately i did not nor did i notice as a result of that failure on the part of citizen one i was again contacted in xxxx by their credit department that i was late again i immediately made months payments current one month in advance and pled with their customer service department to please get a monthly billing statement to me mail it fax it e mail it i did n t care just get one to me this time they promised to mail me a paper statement and e mail me my reminders to date i have n t received either as a result i was late again in xxxx i am not accusing citizen one of intentionally withholding my monthly billing statements but i find it very suspicious that all of my other mail is delivered without incident i am never and i do mean never late with any of my other bills i also find it convenient and profitable that citizen one gains from their own failure they are now refusing to waive xxxx late fees something is very wrong on their end and it is entirely unfair that i am being penalized for not being sent a monthly billing statement which serves as notification that a loan payment in a specific amount is due furthermore i should not be charged fees when my payment is late as a result of neglect or failure on citizen one s part to send me a monthly billing statement i suspect that i am not the only customer of citizen one with this problem i have made exhaustive efforts to remedy this issue with the bank but they are intransigent and so i am filing this compliant to get this situation resolved and on the principles of being fair and taking responsibility for their part in creating this problem get the outstanding late fees waived and ensure delivery of a monthly billing statement

NSpam,my husband opened a health savings account with bank of america benefit solutions when he died in xx xx xxxx there was a substantial balance in the account and i his wife was the beneficiary i knew that irs rules provided that the named spouse beneficiary assumes the account however when i called to discuss the situation i was told the account would be closed and funds sent to me i specifically said i did not want the account to be closed i followed this up with a letter the same day reiterating my wish that the account not be closed and asking that someone contact me about the proper handling of the account i heard nothing when i followed up with a phone call i was told the account was closed and a check was on the way to me i spoke with several people all of whom told me the account had to be closed however i knew irs publication xxxx indicated that upon death of account holder the account is treated as the spouse s hsa the major problem with their closing the account was that they did it around xx xx xxxx against my wishes and at a time when the value of investments in the account had plunged these investments soon rebounded and even gained in value however i missed out on these earnings i filed a complained with the bbb and the bank restored opened an account in my name and cancelled payment on the check to me however the bank has refused to provide me with information about the value of the account as of the date of my husband s death and the holdings in the investment accounts as of his death and as of the date they sold the investments as the law says i should assume this account i am entitled to this information i have attempted to get the information from the bank but they refuse i have no way to know if they restored the correct amount to the account the bank later made a cash deposit to the account apparently correcting some error however i have no information to assess what they have done in effect the bank erroneously made the only investment decisions for the account until i sold the investments in xx xx xxxx as i prepare to move the account to an hsa administrator that is more professional the bank s website information about the treatment of hsa accounts upon accountholder s death has changed more than once since my husband s death and now says the bank has discretion about the treatment of accounts upon death are accountholders subject to the whims of a bank clerk i believe the bank has callously violated my rights and that i have suffered a financial loss as a result without all of the required information it is difficult to assess the damage but i believe that if the account had simply been changed to my name there would be several more thousand dollars in it than there is now to make matters worse this debacle occurred when i was already struggling with the effects of my husband s death while other financial institutions were careful to provide detailed information accounts and options bank of america ignored my request for information and closed the account without any consideration of the effect it would have on its value i believe they are mishandling health savings accounts

NSpam,unfortunately there is yet another problem with xxxx that i must add to my complaint they claim that i owe an refund to a buyer in an xxxx purchaser and they have debited that amount from my xxxx account even though the buyer has yet to return the purchased item to me for a refund this problems came to my attention on xxxx i plan to refund the full amount of on return of the merchandise as is my stated policy on my xxxx auctions but it is coercive and fraudulent for xxxx to freeze my account and disrupt other transactions over a purchase and refund where they are not a principal party or even the actual broker xxxx is the broker more specifically xxxx embargoed xxxx payments to me from other buyers and claim that i still owe them or somebody which i do not at this point in time because they show a negative balance of on my xxxx account the prevent me from paying for my own xxxx purchases with xxxx which is a grave concern because i ve already missed out on buying xxxx item on sale and complicated other purchases most egregiously however is the following i agreed to transfer from my bank account to my xxxx account to bring that account up to a zero balance because that would allow me to pay for xxxx purchases with xxxx and i figured that in the long run all of the various credits and debits would balance out to zero i set up the transfer on xxxx xxxx the money was debited from my bank account yesterday xxxx xxxx but as of today xxxx xxxx it has not been credited to my xxxx account that s fraud xxxx took the money from my bank account but kept it for themselves instead of applying it to my xxxx account i called xxxx about this problem this morning initially spoke with line representative xxxx xxxx xxxx who was useless about fixing the problem eventually transferred to a supervisor xxxx employee id xxxx xxxx unfortunately xxxx also refused to do anything to fix this fraud just blithely repeating that it takes several days to effect such a transfer that s not the point the point is they already have the money but have n t credited to my xxxx account you need to force these crooks to stop screwing over people like me and to treat their customers fairly and respectfully especially by transferring and crediting money immediately on the requests being filed as they do for purchases on xxxx paid with xxxx not depriving clients of the use of their own money and not playing around with floats to earn interest to which they are not entitled and to start with they should never debit peoples xxxx accounts on the unsupported claims of third parties the fact of the matter is that it s my decision if i believe it s appropriate or not to refund money to a buyer as it may not be if the buyer broke the merchandise after using it as may be the case with the buyer who currently wants to return merchandise to me and xxxx and xxxx should not be able to force such a decision on me and definitely should not steal money from me this vertical monopoly of xxxx and xxxx needs to be broken up because it leads to abuses of power by both entities specifically for my current complaint i m asking you to fine xxxx and force them to immediately credit my account the full amount of money that i transferred and that is at issue with the buyer xxxx plus xxxx

NSpam,the credit reporting agency has been re aging the credit accounts reported on my credit report and has caused older negative accounts to look more recent which has adversely effected my employment i have maintained a xxxx for over years and i never ignored my financial obligations but after i was xxxx i requested the scra financial protection from my creditors and my all creditors began filing adverse credit reports increased the interest rates closed all of my accounts within months and reported i had requested the closures i had been making my payments and have had to document my payments and disputed the information for years but the credit reporting agencies always said the creditor has verified the information equifax has provided my credit information to the xxxx and based on that information the xxxx intended to terminate my ability to maintain my xxxx while i was xxxx in xxxx this has resulted in me being unqualified to continue working in my field of expertise as i had for the past years i have found evidence that equifax has been re aging the original accounts reported by my creditors and this is the negative account information that was provided to the xxxx accounts that transferred or sold from one debt collector to another and the date of first activity on the accounts make the delinquency look more resent the dates of the first delinquency should not change the date of first delinquency determines how long a negative account can remain on your credit reports and a negative credit item such as a charge off can only remain on my credit report for years from the date of first delinquency section a says in general a person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection charged to profit or loss after furnishing the information notify the agency of the date of delinquency on the account which shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action this means that if a debt collector reports a date of first delinquency to the credit bureaus and the original creditor previously reported it the dates must be the same date of first delinquency any different date constitutes illegal re aging this re aging of my accounts has cause serious damage to my credit files i m hoping that this will be corrected quickly since i am provided my previous credit reports as attachments as evidence of the original dates of the first delinquency reported the credit report i received from equifax would be empty if not for the re aging of the remaining accounts on your credit report because the fcra requires that information reported be in compliance with the date of first delinquency and the name of the party who reported the date of first delinquency xxxx xxxx filed their first notice of delinquency when i requested that the scra interest rate adjustment to the account because i had been making payments in access of the required amounts and the balance of the account was n t reflecting that their attorney stated that xxxx xxxx was n t required to grant my request for the scra because the contract interest rate was below and any excess payments were applied to the other fees and charges xxxx does n t have the legal right to deny mt scra request without first having a court order granting them the right not to comply with the federal statutes of the scra financial protections and the scra interest rate provision requires a creditor not to accelerate the account for non payments of the obligation until the scra requirements are in compliance ignoring my scra request is n t permitted without a court order and the attorney should have known

NSpam,this is a complaint against first hawaiian bank for its grossly incompetent management of its supposedly new and improved website i ve been a customer since approximately and i have never had problems with my account as bad as i have in the last few months with the roll out of the new site tonight i spent one hour trying very hard to access my account online and then trying to transfer funds along the way i made two phone calls to fhb online where i spoke with a total of four representatives not one of them had even the slightest clue of how badly the site was performing specifically every time i tried to perform any operation the site automatically displayed an error message when i tried to make an external transfer fhb online stopped the attempted transaction and said it would send a code to my phone for verification but fhb never called my phone even after an hour the broken system did nearly the same thing when i tried to re add my xxxx account as an external account fhb displayed a message that my xxxx account credentials were invalid yet these were the same credentials that i have been using on my xxxx account for years so there was nothing wrong with my xxxx online id password or pin but far and away the very worst issue was my truly sad experience with xxxx in the online banking department she said it was bank policy to refuse to provide her last name or even an employee number despite the incredible amount of time xxxx and i spent on the phone with her asking me the same questions over and over again she could not understand that the fhb site was not performing as she expected it to for example she insisted there would be a blue arrow in front of my name after asking me about this three times i refused to answer the same question anymore i had enough with the fhb site and its employees who were deeply in the dark about the site s issues there is obviously something seriously wrong with the fhb website it is not performing adequately while i was on the phone with fhb i had absolutely no problem accessing my xxxx and xxxx accounts so the issue is not my connection and hopefully not even my xxxx browser clearly my access to funds through the site is blocked but i am far more concerned with fhb s employees inability to troubleshoot assist or even acknowledge something is wrong

NSpam,what happened my concern and problem with my bank revolves around my checking account and the line of credit attached to it my current checking account has an existing line of credit for dollars which is both a personal and business checking in xxxx account i ve had this bank account since xx xx xxxx and the line of credit on this account since xx xx xxxx what is my concern two fold first my bank poaches my account how does the bank do that my original line of credit was set up so that i will always receive my monthly bank payment allotment comes from the department of treasury for a pension payment on the day of the month before the payment for the bank fees are due no matter how many times in the past i tried to change the set up so the dates would align in my favor thus avoiding overdraft fees it never worked that way my allotment is like clock work it always arrives on the xxxx day of the month via ach unless there is a holiday or the month ends on a weekend in which case my funds credit a day prior the regular reoccurring direct deposit payment always comes on or before the xxxx of every month and sometimes sooner but never later but the bank does not always credit when they receive my direct deposit thus resulting in small problems with my account my original use of the line of credit meant that if i had an overage the bank would cover it until my incoming deposit would offset the cost thus not charging me for an overdraft or other banking errors or fees but the bank finds ways around that either by taking maintenance payments early or holding up my deposit an extra day even though i have had this account for a very long time since xx xx xxxx the bank takes advantage of me and poaches my account my bank waits to collect the amount for my account maintenance fees usually about until a day before the direct deposit not a day after as i had originally set it up the bank is not open on sunday or saturday but they will balance a maintenance payment against my account on a sunday if the payment arrives on monday even if i wanted to correct the problem i ca n t since the bank is closed and with a payment already scheduled it resolves itself second problem with this besides the costs to me is the bank uses the overages to show a pattern that they now say is shutting down my line of credit what my bank is doing is over drafting my bank account by collecting a maintenance fee within hours of my incoming direct deposit and even if i m only xxxx cents overdrawn and have a pending deposit to offset it they collect the overdraft fees st i am calling this poaching since my bank does this deliberately by aligning payments fees and overages to happen before the direct deposit although they often happen within a day of each other many years ago to stop my bank from taking advantage of me in this way i called and spoke to my banker he told me the bank is not allowed to collect maintenance fees that will overdraft my account he said that if a maintenance fee is due when funds come into the account it covers that cost maintenance fee thus always balancing itself before an overdraft but many years go by and the bank keeps taking the maintenance fees and over drafting my account by a few dollars or less for a payment that is n t even over due more than hours and they do it when the bank is closed the bank seems to know my direct deposit is coming so they collect the payment first and if there is a discrepancy of even a few cents they charge me an overdraft up to because this all happens within a day or so the transactions happen without any time opportunity for me to correct anything to avoid this problem originally i set it up so my direct deposit would always come first before the bank fees are balanced against the account to avoid this problem

NSpam,i have been disputing this information for the past two years and it keeps getting worse my child was in the band when she was in middle school i rented an instrument from xxxx back then and turned it in on time i no longer have anything with them i noticed on my report last year that they were saying the account was days late and i disputed it but nothing was done i disputed it again and then they started reported it as paid as agreed and that i was paying every month i do n t have anything from them nor am i paying on any account so they have it as a creditor and they also have it in my collection section showing that as a negative remark they keep reporting this and it is impacting my credit score dramatically they keep reporting it every single month on moth sides i have sent a letter to xxxx and to the credit bureau and they continue to report it my credit score dropped down when they added it to my current creditors as if i had credit with them 
NSpam,on my experian account there is a company reporting a collections account i have filed a dispute with experian and all they did was send a notice to the collection agency and did not ask the collection agency xxxx xxxx xxxx if they had documented legal proof that i owe this debt i visited the office of this collection agency xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx az and they could not provide any documentation of any form i sent them a registered letter requesting such information and i also contacted the physical therapy office and they could not provide any proof either nor have they called me with any status regarding the claimed debt as they promised i advised experian and asked them why they did not require documented proof from the collection agency and they responded that the business can report to them any information that they want i asked if they require the reporting business to have or provide any type of legal documentation indicating that the person that they are reporting negative information on their credit report they indicated that no basically the reporting company can report whatever they want and experian in their dispute process will only ask them if they want to continue reporting the information whether or not they have any legal grounds to do so my complaint is that the credit reporting agency in their dispute should require that the reporting client of experian should be able to provide legal documentation regarding the information that they are reporting especially in this electronic age where the information could easily be provided and if the creditor or collection agency can not provide such documentation then it must be removed if this agency had any legal documented proof they would have filed legal action against me long ago as i have lived at the same address for over yrs
